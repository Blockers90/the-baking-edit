        <p>Hi there! I'm Becky and i'm the Baker behind The Baking Edit. I started baking in 2017 when I made my first cake for my work Bake-Off. To my surprise, I won! Winning a Bake-Off with my first ever cake gave me a confidence boost and I decided to stick at it.</p>

        <p>I offer a range of cakes and sweet treats in lots of delicious flavours. Anything from wedding cakes, birthday cakes, celebration cakes, cookies, cupcakes and macarons. You name it, i'll make it!</p>
        <p>Popular flavours include:
        <ul></ul>
            <li>Chocolate and Salted Caramel</li>
            <li>Chocolate Orange</li>

            <li>Vanilla and Jam</li>
